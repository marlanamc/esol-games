## üéØ **Suggested Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **IMMEDIATE (Next 1-2 hours)**
1. **Complete Level 2 & 3 Grammar Validation**
   - Fix negative sentence checking ("She does not eat pizza")
   - Implement question formation checking ("Does she eat pizza?")
   - Test all three levels thoroughly

2. **Integrate Live Verb Database**
   - Connect your 229-verb spreadsheet to the game
   - Implement difficulty-based verb selection
   - Add verb frequency filtering

### **SHORT TERM (Next session)**
3. **Question-Answer Cycle**
   - Build Q: "Does she eat pizza?" 
   - Practice A: "Yes, she does" / "No, she doesn't"
   - Add Wh-questions: "What does she eat?" ‚Üí "She eats pizza"

4. **Enhanced Mobile UX**
   - Optimize touch interactions
   - Improve tile sizing for phones
   - Add swipe gestures

### **MEDIUM TERM (Next few sessions)**
5. **Teacher Dashboard MVP**
   - Simple progress tracking
   - Custom word list upload
   - Class management basics

6. **Deployment & Testing**
   - Deploy to public URL
   - Test with real students
   - Gather feedback and iterate

### **FUTURE EXPANSION**
7. **Advanced Grammar Levels**
   - Articles (a/an/the) with countable/uncountable
   - Past tense, future tense
   - Adjectives, adverbs, prepositions

8. **Enhanced Gamification**
   - Leaderboards
   - Daily challenges
   - Collaborative features

## üöÄ **Recommended Focus for Right Now**

**I suggest we focus on completing the core 3-level MVP first:**

1. **Fix Level 2 & 3 grammar checking** (30 minutes)
2. **Integrate your live verb database** (30 minutes) 
3. **Test thoroughly on mobile** (15 minutes)
4. **Deploy for classroom testing** (15 minutes)

This gives you a solid, working tool you can use with students immediately, then we can build the advanced features based on real classroom feedback.

**What do you think? Should we complete the core MVP first, or would you prefer to jump into one of the advanced features?**
