1. **Tag Questions** (super common in conversation)
2. **Phrasal Verbs** (essential for natural English)

## üïê **TIME EXPRESSIONS & TENSE USAGE (CRITICAL!):**

### **21. Time Expressions with Past Simple**
- Pattern: Past verb + specific time (yesterday, last week, in 2020, ago)

- Example: "I have studied English for 3 years" / "Have you ever been to Paris?"
- Why: Key to understanding present perfect usage

### **23. Present Perfect vs Past Simple (Direct Comparison)**
